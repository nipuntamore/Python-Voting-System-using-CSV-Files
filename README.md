" Python Voting System using CSV Files "
<br>
Introduction
<br>
This project is a simple yet powerful Voting System developed in Python, designed to manage voting processes through CSV files for data storage. The system allows users to vote, view candidates, and see results in a secure and efficient manner without the need for external databases.
<br>
CSV files are used to handle the data for:
<br>
Candidate information
<br>
Voter registration
<br>
Voting records
<br>
Results tally
<br>
This approach ensures easy portability, transparency, and simplicity while providing a strong foundation for learning about file handling, data management, and basic authentication in Python.
<br>
The system is ideal for:
<br>
  Small election events (like classroom or community voting)
<br>
  Educational purposes to demonstrate core Python concepts
<br>
  Beginners who want to learn Python file handling and project structuring
